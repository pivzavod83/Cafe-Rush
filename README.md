# Café Rush

A cozy, fast-paced café game made with **pygame**.  
Serve drinks, keep customers happy, and survive the rush.

This game was made as a small personal project — simple mechanics, replayable gameplay, and lots of room for charm.

## Gameplay

You run a tiny café during a busy shift.

Customers arrive with drink orders that must be prepared correctly and served before time runs out.  
The longer you last, the faster and more chaotic the café becomes.

Each playthrough is endless and score-based, so no two shifts feel exactly the same.
